# SMARTAIR Asthma Managing System
## Introduction
SMARTAIR Asthma Managing System is an Android app developed to enhance communication between parents, healthcare providers and children with asthma (patients). Parents
are able to manage multiple children simulataneously including tracking medication use, stock and expiry. Children are provided with gamified technique helpers and
an honorary badge system to promote consistency with managing their condition. In case of an emergency, the app features a triage mode where emergency symptoms are logged
and parents are provided real-time alerts. Additioanlly, parents are easily able to transfer symptom and medication log records to providers with strict access 
over what is seen promoting security and privacy.
## System Architecture
At login, users are prompted to login or register for the app. Parents are required to login via email and password while children login by an access code provided by
their parent after registering the child under their account. Providers login via an access code provided by the parent when they generate the shareable report for 
the child they want to share information about.

Under the parent interface, parents are able to configure badge/streak settings for their children, manage medication/childrens, generate reports for providers, and receive real-time notifications 
for any emergencies. 

Under the child interface, children can access features configured and monitored by their parent, including learning proper inhaler technique, tracking symptoms and medication use, initiating emergency triage, 
and viewing progress badges. All child-entered data feeds into parent-controlled settings, history sharing, badge requirements, and inventory/reminder systems, linking the child’s actions directly to the 
configurations provided through the parent interface.

Under the provider interface, providers are able to see reports configured by the parents regarding patient symptoms/medication logs.
